register_user:
If a user tries to register with a duplicate username, create_user() will raise an error, but it won't be handled properly in the serializer.
If a user tries to register with a duplicate email, it will not raise an error because emails are not unique by default in Django's AbstractUser.

password:
Django uses the PBKDF2 algorithm (by default)
pbkdf2_sha256 → Algorithm
870000 → Number of iterations
Xy3fKzNuQ2pg → Salt
B2fHAB2f3H23fAB2vQ8== → Hashed password
